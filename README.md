# Common Algorithms in Python

This repository contains implementations of common algorithms in Python, categorized into different modules based on their type (e.g., sorting, searching, etc.). The repository also includes corresponding tests using pytest.

## Algorithms

### Sorting
- [Bubble Sort](src/sorting/bubble_sort.py)
- [Quick Sort](src/sorting/quick_sort.py)

### Searching
- [Linear Search](src/searching/linear_search.py)
- [Binary Search](src/searching/binary_search.py)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/yourusername/common_algorithms.git


2. Change to the repository directory:
    - cd common_algorithms

3. Install the required dependencies:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt


_NOTE: It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies._

4. Run the tests using pytest:
